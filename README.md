    Streamlining Inventory Management for Storable Healthcare Products in a Unified Demand Environment <br>
</h1>


## Abstract
In this project, we propose a mathematical model and implementation based on a collab- orative scheme designed to optimize the storage and distribution of medical products to hospi- tals given historical data.

## Challenge

**MAIN GOAL**: Stablish a purchase plan for 2023

*What else can we analyse?*
- Predict the expenses for the following year by product
- Detect purchase patterns and combinations
- Evaluate the environmental impact if purchase strategy changes


## Evaluation Criteria
*What will be measured?*
- **Answer to the business case**

- **Analytical skills**

- **Storytelling & rationale**

- **Innovation**

- **Oral presentation skills**

## Data
Some information about the given data:
