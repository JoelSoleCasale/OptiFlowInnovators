    Streamlining Inventory Management for Storable Healthcare Products in a Unified Demand Environment <br>
</h1>


## Abstract
In this project, we propose a mathematical model and implementation based on a collaborative scheme designed to optimize the storage and distribution of medical products to hospitals given historical data.

## Challenge

**MAIN GOAL**: Stablish a purchase plan for 2023

*What else can we analyse?*
- Predict the expenses for the following year by product
- Detect purchase patterns and combinations
- Evaluate the environmental impact if purchase strategy changes


### Evaluation Criteria
*What will be measured?*
- **Answer to the business case**

- **Analytical skills**

- **Storytelling & rationale**

- **Innovation**

- **Oral presentation skills**

## Data
Some information about the given data:

### consumo_material_clean.xlsx
Purchase history since 2015 for of all the healthcare supplies of a group of hospitals
- `CODIGO` *(object)*: Product code (first letter relates to product classification). Unique identifier of a product
- `PRODUCTO` *(object)*: Product description
- `FECHAPEDIDO` *(Date)*: Purchase date (day/month/year) 
- `NUMERO` *(object)*: Order number/year 
- `REFERENCIA` *(object)*: Reference number
- `CANTIDADCOMPRA` *(Numeric)*: Number of products purchased 
- `UNIDADESCONSUMOCONTENIDAS` *(Numeric)*: Number of units that the product contains
- `PRECIO` *(Numeric)*: Cost in â‚¬
- `IMPORTELINEA` *(Numeric)*: Total cost of products purchase
- `TIPOCOMPRA` *(object)*: Type of public purchase (Compra menor: minor contract / Concurso : public tender) 
- `ORIGEN` *(object)*: Code corresponding to the purchasing region-hospital-department (anonymized data)
- `TGL` *(object)*: Type of logistic distribution of products (transito: directly delivered at the hospital /almacenable: delivered at purchase center) 



## Solution 
*(See paper for more information)*

### Our approach
Supply chain robustness is of paramount importance for businesses, as it not only ensures operational continuity but also provides significant financial benefits. Especially in medical settings, robustness is imperial as the effects of a shortage can cost human lives. Additionally, it is of paramount importance for a company to minimize the ecological footprint stemming from its activities, especially related to transportation which is a major source of pollution, 28% as of 2021.
